# GreenPoll

Create polls quickly and easily on any device.

## Deployment

The app is deployed to [greenpoll.herokuapp.com](https://greenpoll.herokuapp.com/).

## Stack

This project uses a TypeScript backend with [express](http://expressjs.com/), and an Angular frontend. Originally, the backend was written in Rust, but it has since be rewritten.

## Original Project

The original implementation of this project was separated into two repositories and deployments. The Rust backend with [Actix](https://actix.rs/) can be found [here](https://github.com/WKHAllen/GreenPollAPI). The original Angular frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/WKHAllen/GreenPollOld), although there have been few changes to the frontend code.
